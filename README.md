# Welcome to my API project named : **Do I Watch This Movie ?**

The goal of this project is to create an application related with movie search using IMDB movie search API.

## 1. Description of the application

The application I decided to implement is an app that allows the user to get more information about a movie.  
Imagining you are with your friends at home on a Friday night and you want to watch a movie but you don't really know what to watch. Everybody around you is proposing movie name that you have never heard before...

## Here is when **Do I Watch This Movie ?** app comes in !

You can try it directly here : https://doiwatchthismovie.streamlit.app/
